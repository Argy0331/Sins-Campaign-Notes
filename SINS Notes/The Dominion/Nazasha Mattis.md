(She/Her)
CREED: The Tower (Song of Bone)
HOLLOW: The Monster (Song of Flesh)

Known Aliases: Frigg Johansdottier

3/7/24
She comes by Konin once or twice a year
Behind her desk in Konin, four postcard-scale drawings of Shards. In the background the mountain range is always the same. None are in eastern Europe.
Most care in the drawing has been put in the shards (shape, dimensions etc.)
We found a leage ID and papers with the name Frigg Johansdottier, a handgun and a knife.
Also a note that says "Get fucked [[Dymitr]]"

She's a master of the song of bone. Pretty imortant in the Dominion.
