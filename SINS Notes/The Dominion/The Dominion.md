To the west and south-west, lies the awe-some bulk of the Dominion. From Vinenna in their south, to Paris in their west, they are Europe’s superpower, their legions of tamed broodspawn ready to forge a new future in the name of their god-kings.
In reality, the Dominion is a feudal empire, disobeying old-world notions of nation states. Any settlement ruled by a Nemissary can raise the Dominion’s flag provided they subscribe to a single ideological tennant: Nemissaries have been chosen to rule. As such, while in theory, the [[Dominion’s Great Council]] commands all below them, placing much of Europe’s remaining resources at their disposal, in fact each settlement is built in the imagination of their idiosyncratic ruler’s design. These run the gamut from self proclaimed gods ruling over a totally subservient flock to enlightened despots who actually stoop to listening to those beneath them.
In broad strokes, Dominion settlements are not industrialised and comparatively under armed, the Song of Brood defence enough.
