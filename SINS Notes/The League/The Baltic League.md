To the North lies the Dominion’s great rival for both the continent and the future.
The League began as an ad-hoc arrangement between scandinavian governments and the significant NATO forces present along the Russian border during the fall.
To this end, the League considers itself a continuation of the old world nation states and carries it as thus, albeit with a more militaristic bent. Notably, the League’s indigenous heavy industry has largely survived the fall.
However, the League suffers from its own history; the cities of Kalinningrad and Saint Petersburg are treated as military occupation zones rather than full members (a fact that agents of the Dominion are surely exploiting). Secondly, scandinavian farmland continues to be contaminated by radiation storms blowing from the south. Harvests are often lost. Food is rationed and clean food must be imported, usually in trade for the heavy machinery and armaments only the League can provide, although the League continues to refuse heavy weapons to non-aligned settlements.
