3/7/24
Mayor of [[Konin]]
Has had a chunk of his memory wiped, roughly in the past ten years. Says he remembers he "agreed to it", a powerful song was used.
About two years ago, he was asked by [[Nazasha Mattis| Nazasha]] "How his memory was"

He's around his 30s
Woke up and decided to be mayor.

Vision from a shard:
>Two overlapping scenes:
>Fitz sitting at his desk- mayor
>Fitz wearing a military uniform, Green and shiny, looks significatly older, stressed, stacks of paper on his desk.
>Flashes of a concrete wall and a concrete floor.
>Hazy vision of the older Mayor and [[Vanja]], but with much shorter hair, shaking hands.

Second Vision:
>Scene froxen in time.
>top of a tower block, ocean of brood bellow
>The olny light comes from 5 or 6 mushroom clouds frozen in time.
>Box in Fitz's hands, slightly ajar, inside a big shiny red button. We push it. Nuclear blasts reflect in his eyes.
